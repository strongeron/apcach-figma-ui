# APCACH UI - Advanced Color Contrast Tool for Figma

## Description
APCACH UI is a powerful color contrast tool that helps designers create accessible, harmonious color palettes using the advanced APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) contrast model. Unlike traditional WCAG contrast tools, APCACH UI provides more perceptually accurate contrast measurements and helps you generate colors that meet specific contrast requirements while maintaining visual harmony.

## Key Features

### Precise Contrast Control
- Generate colors with exact APCA contrast values (0-108 scale)
- Instantly see how colors perform against different backgrounds
- Create accessible text and UI elements that meet modern contrast standards

### Advanced Color Management
- Work in the Display P3 color space for wider gamut and more vibrant colors
- Visualize colors in multiple formats (HEX, RGB, P3, OKLCH)
- Preview how colors appear in different contexts with real-time updates

### Intuitive Design Tools
- Adjust contrast, chroma (saturation), and hue with interactive sliders
- Generate color previews directly in your Figma document
- Apply colors to selected elements with a single click

### Accessibility Features
- Get detailed APCA contrast information with accessibility recommendations
- See instant feedback on whether colors meet accessibility standards
- Generate accessible color combinations for text, UI elements, and backgrounds

### Seamless Workflow Integration
- Works with your current Figma selection
- Preserves your design context with background color detection
- Creates organized, properly named color previews in your document

## How It Works
1. Select an element or start with our default colors
2. Adjust contrast, chroma, and hue using the intuitive controls
3. Preview colors directly in your Figma document
4. Apply colors to your design elements

APCACH UI helps designers create more accessible, visually pleasing designs by providing precise control over color contrast while maintaining aesthetic harmony. Whether you're designing for accessibility compliance or simply want better control over your color relationships, APCACH UI gives you the tools to create beautiful, accessible designs.

## About APCA
The Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA) is a modern approach to measuring contrast that better reflects how humans perceive color differences, especially for text readability. Unlike older methods, APCA considers factors like font size, weight, and the relative luminance of colors, providing more accurate guidance for creating accessible designs.
