# APCACH UI - Technical Information

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, TypeScript
- **Color Processing**: APCACH library, Culori
- **Contrast Algorithm**: APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm)
- **Color Spaces**: sRGB, Display P3, OKLCH

## Core Components

### APCACH Library

The plugin is built around the APCACH library, which provides:

- Precise contrast calculations using the APCA algorithm
- Color space conversions between sRGB, P3, and OKLCH
- Functions for generating colors with specific contrast values
- Utilities for checking color gamut compatibility

### Figma Plugin API Integration

- Creates and manages frames, text nodes, and color swatches
- Handles selection and background detection
- Applies colors to selected elements
- Manages viewport positioning and UI interactions

### User Interface

- Interactive sliders for contrast, chroma, and hue adjustment
- Real-time color preview with background context
- Multiple color format displays
- Accessibility status indicators and recommendations

## Key Technical Features

### Color Generation

The plugin generates colors using a parametric approach:

1. **Contrast-First Approach**: Colors are generated based on a target contrast value against a background
2. **Perceptual Uniformity**: Uses OKLCH color space for perceptually uniform adjustments
3. **Gamut Mapping**: Automatically adjusts colors to fit within the selected color space (sRGB or P3)

### Display P3 Support

- Generates and displays colors in the wider Display P3 color gamut
- Provides fallbacks for sRGB displays
- Converts between color spaces while preserving perceptual attributes

### APCA Implementation

- Uses the official APCA-W3 algorithm for contrast calculations
- Provides contrast values on a scale of 0-108
- Includes contextual accessibility recommendations based on APCA guidelines

## Architecture

The plugin follows a modular architecture:

- **UI Layer**: Handles user interactions and displays
- **Plugin Core**: Manages communication between UI and Figma
- **Color Engine**: Processes color calculations and transformations
- **Preview Generator**: Creates visual representations in the Figma document

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized color calculations for real-time interactions
- Efficient DOM updates for smooth slider interactions
- Throttled communication between UI and plugin code
- Cached color calculations to reduce redundant processing

## Browser Compatibility

- Works in all browsers that support the Figma web app
- Special handling for browsers with and without P3 color support
- Fallback mechanisms for older browsers

## Future Development

Areas for potential enhancement:

- Color palette generation based on APCA principles
- Integration with design systems and color token workflows
- Advanced color relationship tools (complementary, analogous, etc.)
- Expanded accessibility guidance for different contexts

## Dependencies

- **APCA-W3**: For contrast calculations
- **Culori**: For color space conversions and manipulations
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and code organization

## Contributing

The plugin is open to contributions. Key areas where help is welcome:

- Improved color space conversions
- Enhanced accessibility guidance
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements
